Velvet Cake Recipe

Yield: One 9-inch two-layer cake
Prep: 25 minutes
Bake: 25–30 minutes per layer
Cool: 1 hour

Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups (312 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp fine salt
- 3/4 cup (170 g) unsalted butter, softened
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk, room temperature
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) whole milk, room temperature
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp white vinegar
- Optional: 1–2 tbsp cocoa powder for classic velvet tone

Cream Cheese Frosting
- 8 oz (225 g) cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups (360 g) powdered sugar, sifted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 9-inch round cake pans.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. If using cocoa, whisk it in.
3. In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (2–3 minutes).
4. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla.
5. In a measuring cup, combine buttermilk and milk; add the vinegar and let sit 1 minute.
6. With the mixer on low, alternately add dry ingredients and the milk mixture to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined—do not overmix.
7. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth the tops.
8. Bake 25–30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
9. Cool cakes in pans 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely before frosting.

Frosting
1. Beat cream cheese and butter together until smooth.
2. Gradually add sifted powdered sugar and beat until silky. Mix in vanilla and a pinch of salt.
3. If frosting is too soft, chill briefly; if too stiff, add a teaspoon of milk.

Assembly
1. Level cake layers if needed. Place the first layer on a serving plate and spread a thin crumb coat of frosting. Chill 10–15 minutes.
2. Apply a final even layer of frosting between the layers and around the cake. Smooth or create texture as desired.
3. Chill briefly to set, then serve at room temperature.

Tips
- Use room-temperature ingredients for even mixing.
- For a lighter crumb, gently fold batter at the end instead of high-speed mixing.
- Store in the fridge up to 4 days; bring to room temperature before serving for best flavor.

Enjoy your velvet cake.
